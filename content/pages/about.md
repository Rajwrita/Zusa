47000+ fundraisers, 1400+ Crores, 60 Lakh+ donations, Imagine the number of views and what those views alone can do!

Our generation of young adults are socially responsible citizens who would be willing to support and stand beside those in need. Oftentimes we however face a financial constraint that stops us from being a financial support to more and more causes. 

Sharing the message on various social media platforms and spreading the cause does help in amplifying the voices of those in need. 

If we can combine the idea of sharing the message of a fundraiser and simultaneously aiding the cause financially through those shares, it becomes a win-win situation.
