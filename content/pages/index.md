          Our generation of young adults are socially responsible citizens who
          would be willing to support and stand beside those in need. Oftentimes
          we face a financial constraint that stops us from being a financial
          support to more and more causes.


          Sharing the message on various social media platforms and spreading
          the cause does help in amplifying the voices of those in need.
          However, if we can combine the idea of sharing the message of a
          fundraiser and simultaneously aid the cause financially through those
          shares, it becomes a win-win situation.
